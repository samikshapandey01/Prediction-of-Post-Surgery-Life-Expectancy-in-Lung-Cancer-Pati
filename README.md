The datasets show each patient's relevant metric levels as descriptive features and the target feature is the status of their survival 1 year post-op.
Our goal is to build a model that can accurately classify these patients into their likely
survival ability in order to improve medical practices and urge doctors to reconsider their
procedures or think of new innovative ways to reduce negative outcomes.
